# SDK Analysis (Bonus)

This section provides a constructive analysis of the Saros DLMM SDK from a developer's perspective, highlighting its strengths and identifying potential areas for improvement.

## âœ… Current Strengths

1. **Direct Protocol Access**: The SDK provides a thin wrapper over the on-chain program, giving developers direct and granular control.
2. **Type Safety**: As a TypeScript library with an Anchor IDL, the SDK offers excellent type safety, reducing common errors.
3. **Consistency with Anchor**: The SDK follows standard Anchor conventions, making it familiar to Solana developers.

## ðŸ’¡ Areas for Improvement & Suggestions

The primary opportunity for improvement lies in creating higher-level abstractions to simplify common developer workflows.

### Suggestion 1: A `SarosClient` Helper Class

A helper class could encapsulate much of the boilerplate, especially the repetitive PDA derivations.

**Proposed Workflow with `SarosClient`:**

```typescript
// Proposed high-level SDK
const sarosClient = new SarosClient(connection, wallet);
const signature = await sarosClient.swap({
  pair: PAIR_ADDRESS,
  inputMint: TOKEN_X_MINT,
  outputMint: TOKEN_Y_MINT,
  amountIn: 1_000_000,
  slippageBps: 50 // 0.5%
});
```

### Suggestion 2: Liquidity Shape Builders

The `liquidityDistribution` array is powerful but complex. The SDK could provide helper functions to generate common distributions.

```typescript
import { LiquidityShapes } from '@saros-finance/dlmm-sdk';
const distribution = LiquidityShapes.spot({ bins: 21 });
const curved = LiquidityShapes.curve({ bins: 21, concentration: 0.8 });
```
