# Welcome to the Saros SDK Documentation

This site provides comprehensive guides, tutorials, and examples to help you start building on the Solana blockchain with the Saros Finance SDKs.

This documentation is designed to be a practical, developer-first resource that cuts through the complexity and accelerates your time to deployment. Whether you're integrating swaps, providing liquidity, or building complex DeFi applications, these guides are structured to get you from zero to shipping as quickly as possible.

This documentation was created for the [Saros SDK Guide Challenge on Superteam Earn](https://earn.superteam.fun/listing/saros-sdk-guide-challenge).

## Target SDKs

This guide focuses primarily on the `@saros-finance/dlmm-sdk`, but the principles can be applied to other Saros SDKs.

- **`@saros-finance/dlmm-sdk` (Focus)**: A dedicated TypeScript SDK for the Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM).
- **`@saros-finance/sdk`**: The primary TypeScript SDK for the classic AMM, Staking, and Farming.
- **`saros-dlmm-sdk-rs`**: The Rust SDK for interacting with the DLMM from on-chain programs.
